This folder contains three R function codes and one R script used to run the M/M/1/k queue example presented in the paper (). The functions are described below:
* MG1k.LindleySteadyState.R: simulates one observation of time in system of a job in the M/G/1/k queue in (approximate) steady state. 
* MM1k.LindleySteadyState.Parametric.R: simulates one observation of time in system of a job in the M/G/1/k queue in (approximate) steady state. 
* runMacro.shrinkage.MM1k.R:
* This is the script that runs macro replications presented in the paper
