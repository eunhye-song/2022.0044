Summary of results files for capacitated Jackson Network experiments

The file names can be decoded as follows:

Filename: ROARMM4_n100N10r10newCIJN

ROARMM4 - metamodel-based bootstrap confidence intervals for the m = 4 capacitated Jackson Network
n100 - n = 100/1000 in Table 3
N10 - average waiting time of 10 jobs after warmup
r10 - R = 10 in Table 3
newCIJN - final version of code with choice of c_lo as described in Section 5

Filename: JacksonD4out_n100N10r10newCIJN

(same interpretation, but computes confidence intervals using non-metamodel methods)

Note that both text files generated by the R code and the Excel files with summary statistics are included.

Also included are the summary table spreadsheets for Tables 3 and 4:
4_input_network_results_revised.for.TeX
and
10_input_network_results_revised.for.TeX
